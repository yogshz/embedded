This piece of code represents experimenting on a few microcontroller boards, e.g: AVR, STM32 (blue-pill), aimed at learning bare-metal programming. The code may not be accurate to be used for any specific project. It is neither optimized nor verified for any operation. It is only meant for learning how each microcontroller works under the hood using bare-metal programming (no libraries).
